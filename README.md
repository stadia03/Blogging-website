Hey leads, I have created a Blogging website where you can read,post,edit,delete blogs.
I have used node.js as my server and express framework to work with mongodb database.

For the frontend I have used HTML,CSS and ofcourse Bootstrap : )

Here is the front page:

Blogs are sorted according to the date added.

You can create a new blog.

You will be redirected to your blog with a slug url not that random ugly mongodb id

I have used the slugify library for this.

You can edit the blogs.
